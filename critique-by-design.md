# Critique and Redesign

_For each step below, you should document your progress as you move forward.  In terms of tone, think of the writeup as though you're keeping journal of your step-by-step process.   You should include a any insights you gained from the critique method, and what it led you to think about when considering the redesign.  You should talk about how you moved next to the sketches, and any insights you gleaned from your user feedback.  Document what you changed based on the user feedback in your redesign.  Finally, talk about what your redesigned data visualization shows, why you selected the data visualization you did, and what you attempted to show or do differently._

_You can include screenshots, sketches or other artifacts with your narrative to help tell the story of how you moved through the process.  Again, make sure to avoid including any personally identifying information about your interviewees (don't list full names, etc.).  While this template serves as a guide, make sure to reference the assignment writeup on Canvas for the official guidance.  This template does not include all guidance mentioned on the assignment page._

## Step one: the visualization

The visualization I chose was "Total yearly cost to study in select European countries," from an article called "The cheapest countries to study in Europe." 

Here is the website:
https://www.finder.com/uk/current-accounts/student-bank-accounts/cheapest-countries-to-study-europe.

Here is the visualization (code provided by the website):
<iframe title="Total yearly cost to study in select European countries (Â£)" 
  aria-label="Map" 
  id="datawrapper-chart-UamQC" 
  src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/UamQC/3/" 
  scrolling="no" 
  frameborder="0" 
  style="width: 0; 
  min-width: 100% !important; 
  border: none;" 
  height="736" 
  data-external="1">
  
  </iframe><script 
             type="text/javascript">!function()
             {"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",
                                                   (function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])
                                                   {var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");
                                                    for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])
                                                      for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source)
                                                      {var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
  </script>

I selected this data visualization because I felt that studying in European countries is a topic that would interest a wide range of audiences. As an arts management student, I believe this topic resonates not only with Europeans but also with future arts managers around the world, since Europe has a rich history in both performing and visual arts and offers space for both classical and experimental/modern works. People from other industries may share similar interests as well.

I wanted to see how a data visualization on this topic could help audiences learn more about the cheapest countries to study in Europe, and to consider whether, if I were to design the visualization myself, I could tell a clearer story.

## Step two: the critique
_Don't forget to complete the Google Form found on the assignment page.  You can summarize your thoughts here._

## Step three: Sketch a solution

## Step four: Test the solution

_Before you conduct your interviews, prepare a simple script.  Use this as a guide and as a way to take notes as you go forward. Come up with your own list of questions you want to ask for the selected visualization. Keep the questions broad so you can get the most value out of your feedback. Then, document answers to your questions here._

Questions to ask (modify these for your own interviews): 

- Can you tell me what you think this is?

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

Results: 

_Don't identify or share personally identifiable information (PII) about the people you spoke to._


| Question | Interview 1 | Interview 2 |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |

Synthesis: 

_What patterns in the feedback emerge?  What did you learn from the feedback?  Based on this feedback, come up with what design changes you think might make the most sense in your final redesign._

## Step five: build the solution

_Include and describe your final solution here. It's also a good idea to summarize your thoughts on the process overall. When you're done with the assignment, this page should all the items mentioned in the assignment page on Canvas(a link or screenshot of the original data visualization, documentation explaining your process, a summary of your wireframes and user feedback, your final, redesigned data visualization, etc.)._
