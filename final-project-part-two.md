# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project.

## Interview script

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|   Ensure the story flow is easy to follow and logically coherent   |   Is the flow easy to follow? Are there any logical gaps? Do you wish to see more context information?   |
|   Ensure the visualizations are clear and convey the intended message   |     Are the visualizations easy to read? Is anything confusing when you look at them?     |
|   Ensure my story has a strong call to action   |    After reading this, do you feel like you understand the key takeaway? What actions would you consider taking based on this story?     |

## Interview findings

| Questions               | In-class critique participant 1 | In-class critique participant 2 | In-class critique participant 3 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Is the flow easy to follow? Are there any logical gaps? Do you wish to see more context information? | "I wish there is a better transition from recoupment rates to audience demographics. Maybe you can mention attendence rate." |  "I think the flow is good! But I wondered why you need to talk about both gross revenue and recoupment rate?"   |   "I thought the shift in audience preference to livestream and other at-home activities only affect movie theaters? Are they also affecting live performances?"   |
|   Are the visualizations easy to read? Is anything confusing when you look at them?     |    "I think if you want to show on your line chart that gross revenue has returned to pre-pandemic level, you can add a horizontal line showing the pre-pandemic peak value."     |      "No, I like how you use the same color codes for plays and musicals for all your visualizations, this feels consistent."       |      "For the chart showing recoupment rate, you may want to clarify that the horizontal line you drew represents the average recoupmnent rate pre-COVID."     |
|    After reading this, do you feel like you understand the key takeaway? What actions would you consider taking based on this story?    |   "I think I understand how you got to your suggestion of providing recordings on platforms, but I also wondered why producers can't just produce plays if they have higher recoupment rates."     |    "I like your proposal of diversifying the revenue streams."    |    "I think the key takeaway for me is that producers need to think about how they can be more prepared if COVID hits again, and doing a hybrid model would definitely help mitigate the risk."    |
