I have made some adjustments to the story outline. Here is what I currently have:

## Broadway’s Return to Pre-Pandemic Levels?
The project will begin by presenting: Broadway theaters are once again reporting gross revenue that looks comparable to pre-pandemic years. This sets the context for the audience to consider whether Broadway’s recovery is as straightforward as it appears.

## Looking Beneath the Surface
This section will mention that research shows the cost of production for a Broadway show rises 5% per year, so solely looking at gross revenue is not enough. By looking at the recoupment rate data, only plays this past season were able to reach the pre-pandemic average recoupment rate.

Taking a deeper dive, we see that most of these recouped plays have celebrities in them, which leads to high ticket prices. However, this is not sustainable (detailed reasoning in shorthand and also down below in the “Identified Changes for Part III” section).

What producers need to pay more attention to is improving long-term attendance for the shows that don’t have movie stars.

## Attendance Rate and Audience Demographics
The project then visualizes the shifts in attendance rate and audience demographics of Broadway shows, showing that attendance rate does not reach the pre-pandemic level and may be stagnant.

## Shifting Preferences and Emerging Opportunities
The final section will visualize a general post-pandemic shift in audience preferences, including a greater preference for digital entertainment instead of in-person live performance. Some Broadway shows and other large theater organizations have already started to explore such hybrid model. This may present new opportunities for general managers and producers to diversify revenue and expand reach.

## Note
Please not that the above is subject to change, please see the Shorthand page for the most up-to-date version.

# User research 

## Target audience
My target audience will be Broadway producers. They are responsible for the overall business, creative, and financial aspects of a production that will eventually be staged in the Broadway theatre district in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. They act as the show's "CEO" and have final says in finding a script, raising funds, picking the creative team, overseeing marketing, and guiding the project from development through its run. Although many hands-on works are done by General Management companies, producers have overaching power in critical decisions to ensure the show's success and financial viability. 

The goal of my project is to give Broadway producers a clearer understanding of the current industry’s challenges and opportunities, as the ecosystem have shifted in many aspects post-COVID, and provide some possible future directions that ensure profitability while not harming the long-term health of the industry.

## Interview script

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|   Ensure the story flow is easy to follow and logically coherent   |   Is the flow easy to follow? Are there any logical gaps? Do you wish to see more context information?   |
|   Ensure the visualizations are clear and convey the intended message   |     Are the visualizations easy to read? Is anything confusing when you look at them?     |
|   Ensure my story has a strong call to action   |    After reading this, do you feel like you understand the key takeaway? What actions would you consider taking based on this story?     |

## Interview findings

| Questions               | In-class critique participant 1 | In-class critique participant 2 | In-class critique participant 3 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Is the flow easy to follow? Are there any logical gaps? Do you wish to see more context information? | "I wish there is a better transition from recoupment rates to audience demographics. Maybe you can mention attendence rate." |  "I think the flow is good! But I wondered why you need to talk about both gross revenue and recoupment rate?"   |   "I thought the shift in audience preference to livestream and other at-home activities only affect movie theaters? Are they also affecting live performances?"   |
|   Are the visualizations easy to read? Is anything confusing when you look at them?     |    "I think if you want to show on your line chart that gross revenue has returned to pre-pandemic level, you can add a horizontal line showing the pre-pandemic peak value."     |      "No, I like how you use the same color codes for plays and musicals for all your visualizations, this feels consistent."       |      "For the chart showing recoupment rate, you may want to clarify that the horizontal line you drew represents the average recoupmnent rate pre-COVID."     |
|    After reading this, do you feel like you understand the key takeaway? What actions would you consider taking based on this story?    |   "I think I understand how you got to your suggestion of providing recordings on platforms, but I also wondered why producers can't just produce plays if they have higher recoupment rates."     |    "I like your proposal of diversifying the revenue streams."    |    "I think the key takeaway for me is that producers need to think about how they can be more prepared if COVID hits again, and doing a hybrid model would definitely help mitigate the risk."    |


# Identified changes for Part III

| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| There is a gap between recoupment analysis and audience demographics, and I need to address why producing plays may not be the recommended course of action. | I will analyze more deeply why, in the 2024–25 season, plays have a higher recoupment rate. Research shows that one of the primary reasons is the casting of famous movie actors. However, this trend is not sustainable for the long term, since these productions are usually limited runs (often just a few months). The long-term health of Broadway depends on productions with extended runs, which provide stability for everyone involved. Producers should therefore consider strategies to sustain attendance in productions without relying on celebrity casting. This addition will address both identified issues. |
|  There is a lack of context regarding why both gross revenue and recoupment rate need to be discussed, and what exactly recoupment means. | I will explain that gross revenue is one of the most common measures of success and is frequently cited. However, because production costs rise around 5% annually, gross revenue alone is insufficient for evaluating success. Recoupment is a crucial concept in the theater industry: it measures whether a show’s net profits are sufficient to repay the initial capitalization invested by producers and investors. I will ensure more context is provided to clarify this distinction. |
|  Visualization improvement: make it easier to compare pre-pandemic peak gross revenue and 2024–25 season gross; make the 20% average recoupment rate line clearer.  |  While I believe it’s important to simplify the comparison, I decided to only display number labels for the 2018–19 season and the 2024–25 season. Adding another line might distract from the main story. However, I will clearly label the 20% reference line so that viewers understand it represents the average pre-pandemic recoupment rate.  |

I am grateful for all the constructive feedback I received. While each individual comment did not provide the exact solution for closing the gap in my story or pointing to a clearer call to action, taken together they helped me identify the underlying problem and improve the overall story flow.

I expect to make additional small adjustments as I fully develop my story and finalize the visualizations, and I’m looking forward to seeing where I end up.
