# Outline

## Project Summary
 
As a Master of Arts Management student at Heinz College, Carnegie Mellon University, with a focus on theatre management and production and aspirations to work in New York City after graduation, I have always been curious about Broadway productions and the current Broadway ecosystem from a general manager’s or producer’s perspective. Through this research and data visualization project, I aim to provide insights that would be valuable for new and incoming general managers and producers as they step into the industry.

The COVID-19 pandemic had a severe impact on Broadway theaters. From March 2020 to June 2021, theaters were closed for 15 months, leading to the permanent closure of many shows. Reopening required the careful coordination of numerous stakeholders across all aspects of production, from the stage to backstage, from front of house to audience management (NYU, n.d.). Now, more than four years later, Broadway’s gross revenue and attendance appear to be returning to pre-pandemic levels (The Broadway League, 2025). However, these trends only tell part of the story. Producers must also consider deeper factors such as recoupment rates, shifting audience demographics, and changing audience preferences shaped by the lockdown years. 

The goal of my project is to give emerging Broadway general managers and producers a clearer understanding of the current industry’s challenges and opportunities, while also sharing lessons learned from the pandemic that may help guide future directions and prepare for similar shutdowns.

### Broadway’s Return to Pre-Pandemic Levels?
The project will begin by presenting: Broadway theaters are once again reporting gross revenue and attendance figures that look comparable to pre-pandemic years. This sets the context for the audience to consider whether Broadway’s recovery is as straightforward as it appears.

### Looking Beneath the Surface
This section will compare the real value, instead of the nominal value, of ticket prices, the gross revenue, and recoupment of Broadway theaters across different types of shows. The goal is to analyze the industry’s current financial health compared with the pre-pandemic condition.

### Audience Demographics and Risks
The project then visualizes the shifts in audience demographics of Broadway shows, including the dependence on tourism and possible other traits. This section will also raise the question: what happens if a major disruption, such as another lockdown, occurs again?

### Shifting Preferences and Emerging Opportunities
The final section will visualize a general post-pandemic shift in audience preferences, including a greater preference for digital emtertainment instead of in-person live performance. Some Broadway shows and other large theater organizations have already started to explore such hybrid model. This may present new opportunities for general managers and producers to diversify revenue and expand reach.

## One Sentence Summary
This project uses data visualization to explore how Broadway has recovered since the pandemic, analyzing challenges in financial sustainability and shifts in audience demographics, as well as opportunities that new general managers and producers can consider as they enter the industry.

# The data
My project will use several publicly available industry datasets. The Broadway League’s seasonal statistics (2014–2015 through 2024–2025) provide gross revenue, attendance, and ticket price data, which serve as the foundation for my analysis of Broadway’s financial recovery. I anticipate using a line chart to show the overall trend.

The more detailed Broadway League seasonal statistics, along with the recoupment information on Broadway News, will add depth to the analysis of Broadway’s financial health. I will use a line chart to show the detailed seasonal statistics and a bar chart to show the recoupment percentage in the years post-COVID.

A stacked bar chart using data from the Broadway League’s audience demographic report will emphasize the large percentage makeup of tourists in Broadway’s audience, showing the risks the industry may face if another lockdown happens.

Finally, I will draw data from the Motion Picture Association’s 2021 THEME Report to place Broadway trends in the context of broader shifts toward digital and streaming entertainment post-pandemic, which leads to possible future directions for a hybrid business model.

I understand that in some of the sources, charts are provided instead of datasets. However, I will extract a portion of the numerical data related to my project from the charts and create my own version of the visualizations.

As I further explore my topic, I may add more datasets to create visualizations.

# Method and medium
I plan to publish my final project on Shorthand. All the textual content will also be created on this platform. For my data visualizations, I anticipate using a combination of Shorthand and Tableau, depending on the type and style of the visualizations I want to create. Right now, my visualizations are mostly line charts and bar charts (both side-by-side and stacked), but I will explore more ways to visualize my data in the coming week.
