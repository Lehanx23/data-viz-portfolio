# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!

# About me
Hi! My name is Lehan Xu, and I use she/her/hers pronouns. I am a second-year Master of Arts Management student at Heinz College, Carnegie Mellon University. I also completed my undergraduate studies at CMU, majoring in Economics and Statistics with minors in Business Administration and Drama.

# What I hope to learn
1. I hope to learn how to improve my use of design elements, such as color, text, layout, and visualization type, so that they are accessible and clear.
2. I hope to learn critique methodologies and practice giving fair, constructive critiques of data visualizations, along with recommendations for improvement.
3. I hope to develop the ability to make effective design decisions within context, ensuring that the narrative of a visualization aligns with the larger story.

When I graduate from the program, I would love to work as an Arts Manager with a focus on the performing arts industry. I believe it is essential to create charts that are accessible, clear, and purposeful - charts that tell a story aligned with their intended message, especially when the audience include people of different backgrounds who may not be familiar with data.

## Other stuff you can do (you can remove this section - it's just for your reference.)

### Changing text

You can change text, like this: 

**Here's some bold** text.  Here's some *italic* text. Here's some ~~strikethrough~~ text. 

### Creating tables

You can build tables like this: 

| Name         | Type of pet | Favority activity 1 | FA 2   | FA 3            | FA 4                                |
|--------------|-------------|---------------------|--------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
| Eli          | cat         | Sleeping            | Eating | Being pet       | Plotting to overthow dog empire     |
| Howard       | dog         | You                 | You    | You             | Eating                              |
| Frankenstein | fish        | Swimming            | Eating | Blowing bubbles | Forgetting                          |

An easy-to-use template generator tool [can be found here](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables)

You can use different headings, like this: 

# Here's a large title (H1)
## Here's a subtitle (H2)
### ...and so on (H3)
You get the idea - just don't forget the space between the # and your title.  `#Title` won't work, but `# Title` will. 

### Adding images

Here's an example of how to add an image to my portfolio.

Alternately, you can set the size of the image using just a bit of HTML: 

<img src="funny-dog-unsplash.jpg" width="200"/>

Remember that you'll need to upload the image into your repository, or include a link to the image somewhere else.  

### Setting up a separate page

So here's the code you'll need to add to your own site to create a second page. 

1. First, create a new page in your repository (for example, dataviz1.md)
2. Next, add a link to that page by inserting the following into your readme.md page:

`[title](dataviz)` or `[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` or `[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)`

Any of those formats will work. Here's some examples of working links: 

`[title](dataviz)` = [title](dataviz)  
`[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` = [dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)  
`[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)` = [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)   

Make sure to check these from your publicly accessible URL to make sure they're working correctly (not from the preview tab).
